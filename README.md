## Tech and skills
In addition to my technical skills, my background as a front office worker and later as a technical archaeologist has given me the opportunity to work on my soft skills and communication skills.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Rafael's Coding Journey🤠</h3></summary>
 I started my coding journey as an archaeologist, dissatisfied with the repetitive tasks and lack of efficiency in the way we (the archaeologists) manage our data. During my studies I became curious about computer science and its applications in 'non-computer based' fields like mine and other 'human sciences', as we call them in Spain. One day I finally took the step and started learning to code in order to create tools that I and my colleagues seemed to need, and I went down the deepest rabbit hole I could ever imagine.
 Long story short, I didn't create the tool I was looking for, but I did learn something that I eventually came to love as much as my other hobbies.
